# 🩸 Godot 2d shooter

A Vampire Survivors–inspired 2D roguelike shooter made with Godot & GDScript

## 🎮 Overview

You are a flower who is really good at throwing stuff.  

Survive as long as you can, gather coins, upgrade your abilities, and see how long you can survive. 
## ⚔️ Core Gameplay

Pick up and throw objects at enemies – the central mechanic.

Endless waves of enemies with varied behaviors and patterns.

Coins & progression: Every defeated enemy drops coins. Collect enough and you can buy upgrades mid-run.

Smart upgrade system:

Spend coins to improve your character.

Leftover coins carry over, so buying cheaper upgrades means faster access to the next one.

## 🔁 Roguelike Progression

Randomized runs for replayability.

Multiple upgrade paths (damage, throw speed, pickup range, survivability, etc.).

Synergize upgrades to build your own playstyle.

## 🛠️ Built With

Written entirely in GDScript
