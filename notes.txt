Outlining this game:
- Theme?
- Mechanic: throwing
- Rougelike
- Upgrade during run
- Survive for as long as possible

General problems:
- screen size and scaling
- art
- getting satisfying good movement (cuphead, mario, helldivers2)
- throwing collision with player

Good chatgpt theme idea:
Garden Gnome Gladiators:
	Theme: Garden gnomes come to life and engage in playful combat.
	Setting: Garden, backyard, flower beds.
	Enemies: Rival gnomes, mischievous animals, garden pests.
	Weapons: Tiny shovels, pebbles, garden hose, flower pots.

Create a tileset and use wave function collapse to assemble the map
Tiles have a black background and pixelart similar to dwarf fortress's ascii tileset

How can we make characters that look good on that tileset?
- Maybe use light/white outlines


Art:
- create a color palette
- create a tile set
- create a player sprite
- create a item sprite
- enemy sprite
- projectile sprite
