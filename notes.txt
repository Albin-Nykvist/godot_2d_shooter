Outlining this game:
- Theme?
- Mechanic: throwing
- Rougelike
- Upgrade during run
- Survive for as long as possible


General problems:
- getting satisfying good movement (cuphead, mario, helldivers2)


Good chatgpt theme idea:
Garden Gnome Gladiators:
	Theme: Garden gnomes come to life and engage in playful combat.
	Setting: Garden, backyard, flower beds.
	Enemies: Rival gnomes, mischievous animals, garden pests.
	Weapons: Tiny shovels, pebbles, garden hose, flower pots.
	

Each round you buy new items to spawn for you to throw. (this game has a weird theme)
	How do items spawn? Is it important?

There should be some world specific enemies and items, but it should also be somewhat random, like helldivers.

The game is about a character that uses improvised tactics to fight, such at throwing objects, using the environment 
and tricking enemies into attacking each other. 

The game is a horde survival game.

You fight in rooms and when you have survived the time you get to the next one.

The games story is where i am having trouble. Since it is about surviving i think it would be cool if you where doing
some kind of trial.
